  Dear ${manager},
  
  I am writing to apply for the position of ${role} at ${company}. With my background in software development and passion for creating user-centered applications, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.
  
  During my 3-month internship, I developed web tools such as a coupon code generator, URL shortener with redirection, WordPress pages, and React.js projects. These experiences strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.
  
  In my previous role at [Previous Company], I successfully [mention a key achievement]. I believe this experience aligns well with the goals of ${company} and the requirements of the ${role} role.
  
  I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences can benefit ${company}. Thank you for considering my application.
  
  Sincerely,  
  ${data.fullName}
